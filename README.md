# 📱 App-ionic

Crafted during classes with Professor Jonathan, App-ionic stands as a hands-on demonstration of mobile application development concepts.

## 🎬 Movie Application

This project is designed to showcase registered movies and actors. It has been developed using **Ionic**, a robust framework for creating both mobile and desktop applications. Ionic leverages standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One of its standout features is its ability to produce cross-platform applications from a single codebase, optimizing development time and reducing costs.

This project was a highlight of the 3rd lecture in the **Web Application Development and Deployment** course, taught by Master Jonathan Alexander Castro Eras.

Before diving in, ensure the following are installed:

- Python 3.11
- Django 4.2.4

### Setting Up the Environment

We recommend creating a virtual environment to ensure project dependencies are isolated:

```bash
# Within your project directory
npm i -g @ionic/cli                     # Installs the Ionic CLI
npx ionic generate page new-page        # Generates a new page in the app
pip install django-cors-headers         # Adds the CORS package for Django security
ionic serve                             # Launches the application
```
